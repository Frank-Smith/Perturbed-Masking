Speaking of the $T$ , it too has problems .

The $T$ is too slick .

Nightly my computer defrags itself and runs a $T$ .

I was happy with My purchase of a Toshiba Satellite L305D-S5934 laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the $T$ .

The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a $T$ underscores the value of this machine .

The fact that you can spend over $ 100 on just a webcam underscores the $T$ of this machine .

I mainly use it for email , $T$ , and managing personal files -LRB- pics , vids , etc. -RRB- .

A month or so ago , the freaking $T$ just died .
4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0
The $T$ it comes with does not work properly , so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all .
4.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0
Then after 4 or so months the $T$ stopped working so I was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running .
7.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 14.0 13.0 12.0

If a website ever freezes -LRB- which is rare -RRB- , its really easy to $T$ .
9.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 9.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
It rarely $T$ and when it does it 's incredibly slow .
1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0
I also enjoy the fact that my MacBook Pro laptop allows me to run $T$ on it by using the VMWare program .
2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 5.0

It 's so much easier to navigate through the $T$ , to find files , and it runs a lot faster !

Purchased a Toshiba Lap top it worked good until just after the $T$ went out .
8.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
I wanted to purchase the $T$ and they refused , because they knew it was trouble .
8.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 8.0
We upgraded the $T$ to four gigabytes in order to take advantage of the performace increase in speed .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0

The reality was , it heated up very quickly , and took way too long to do simple things , like $T$ .
7.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 10.0 11.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
I had always used PCs and been constantly frustrated by the crashing and the poorly designed $T$ that were never very intuitive .
12.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0
Then , within 5 months , the $T$ crapped out on me .
3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
And if you have a iphone or ipod touch you can connect and download songs to it at high $T$ .
4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
I love the $T$ .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
I continued to take the computer in AGAIN and they replaced the $T$ and mother board yet again .
3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0

I am using the $T$ - sound is good .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0
I am using the external speaker - $T$ is good .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0
still testing the $T$ as i thought it would be better , but am very happy with the upgrade .

Then HP sends it back to me with the $T$ screwed up , not able to connect .
2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0
Oh yeah , do n't forget the expensive $T$ to and from HP .
3.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0
Everything is so easy to use , $T$ is just so much simpler than Microsoft software .

2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0
$T$ on the outside were alright but i did not track in Core Processing Unit temperatures .

Going to bring it to $T$ today .
2.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
There is no need to purchase $T$ , which saves me a lot of time and money .

2.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0
So , I paid a visit to $T$ at Alexandra Road , hoping they can make the hinge tighter .

3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0
It is always reliable , never bugged and $T$ well .

After about a week I finally got it back and was told that the $T$ had failed and so they installed a new motherboard .

they had to replace the $T$ in April
3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 3.0
Yes , the computer was light weight , less expensive than the average laptop , and was pretty self explantory in $T$ .

Also , if you need to talk to a $T$ , there is a charge , which I believe is robbery , since you are charged enormous amounts for a very badly designed system , which most people would have went with XP if they could .

Taking it back to Best Buy I found that a tiny plastic piece inside had broken -LRB- $T$ issue -RRB- .

2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
The AMD Turin processor seems to always perform so much better than $T$ .
4.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
After that the said it was under $T$ .
3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
The $T$ is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking .

The $T$ said he had tried to duplicate the damage and was n't able to recreate it therefore it had to be their defect .
3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 11.0 11.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
The $T$ I purchased this from sent it back , , , , , eventually I got a new or repaired machine approximately 3 weeks later .
6.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0
Really like the textured $T$ which shows no fingerprints .
4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
The $T$ is bright and the keyboard is nice ;

High $T$ , however .
3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0
I thought learning the $T$ would be hard , but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with a PC .

This computer had exactly the $T$ I needed .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0
My kids -LRB- and dogs -RRB- destroyed two $T$ by pulling on them .
2.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
I had upgraded my old MacBook to Lion , so I kind of knew what I was getting , but had n't been able to enjoy some of the awesome new $T$ .
11.0 16.0 15.0 14.0 19.0 18.0 17.0 16.0 15.0 16.0 17.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 11.0 12.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 14.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
The $T$ is a little glary , and I hated the clicking buttons , but I got used to them .
4.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0
The screen is a little glary , and I hated the $T$ , but I got used to them .
2.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0
Not to mention , the $T$ is absolutely amazing .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0
$T$ also shuts the computer down for no reason without warning .
0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0
not using $T$ not sure what thats about .
3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0
Now for the $T$ problems .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
Anyways I bought this two months ago and when I first brought it home it kept giving me a message about a vibration in the $T$ and it is putting it temporaly in save zone .
2.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 10.0 11.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 4.0 3.0
It 's fast and has excellent $T$ .
1.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
$T$ included .
0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0
Features like the $T$ are very block-like and old school .
2.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
$T$ like the font are very block-like and old school .
0.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
It is loaded with $T$ that is of no good for the average user , that makes it run way to slow .
8.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0
It is loaded with programs that is of no good for the average user , that makes it $T$ way to slow .
2.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0
I feel that it was poorly put together , because once in a while different $T$ would come off of it .
2.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0
Finally , I should note that I took the $T$ from my old EeePC and installed it before I even powered on for the first time .
6.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 11.0
$T$ is also rather unsteady on its feet and is susceptible to many bugs .
0.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0
After sending out documents via email and having recipients tell me they could not open the documents or they came through as gibberish , I broke down and spent another $ 100 to get $T$ .
1.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
DO NOT BUY GATEWAY COMPUTERS THEY ARE JUNK AND THE $T$ IS HORRIBLE .
7.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 5.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
then on top of it all their $T$ is in the middle east .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0
The only bad part is the $T$ / weight .
5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
The only bad part is the size / $T$ .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
The little $T$ that it did have would only last about an hour while just having it on the desktop .
2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 9.0 8.0
I liked the $T$ .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
Its good for playing my apps on Facebook or $T$ .
4.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0

3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0
From the $T$ to the performance , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .
17.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 17.0 18.0
From the build quality to the $T$ , everything about it has been sub-par from what I would have expected from Apple .

I love the $T$ where I can simply drop a file ontop of a particular program , and the program will simply open that file .
2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 17.0 18.0

pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops $T$ out of no were .
1.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0

2.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 8.0 7.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
A coupla months later , they change my $T$ .
1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
The Macbook arrived in a nice $T$ and sealed in the box , all the functions works great .

2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0
I bought this laptop because of the $T$ to price ratio .

After having two PC laptops die with in the past 3 years , I was led to the Apple display at Best Buy by the sleek $T$ and promise of less tech issues .

For the $T$ to work properly , you must install the Launch Manager on the Drivers/Applications DVD , or it will not show after the reload .

It 's not a wear-and-tear issue , not due to user carelessness and most importantly , they CA N'T guarantee the problem will be solved if it is sent for $T$ and I have to accept the outcome .

7.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0
When we bought our new HP comouter in Dec. of 2008 , we wanted Windows XP , but were told it would cost an extra $ 159 , so we went with $T$ .
11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 12.0 11.0 12.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 11.0 9.0 10.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
The only thing that I have , is the $T$ is a little dark to see the letters , would help if it was a little lighter then it is .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 12.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 7.0
I 'm still within the one year $T$ but the repair `` depot '' has deemed that this time it was caused by physical abuse and is not covered .

But I needed a laptop for $T$ .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
This is the complete opposite to an ergonomic $T$ .

I would like at least a 4 hr . $T$ .

The only thing that I do n't like about my mac is that sometimes there are $T$ that I want to be able to run and I am not able to .
3.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0

Long story short , since I experience so many problems with my laptop every since I bought it from day one , I did n't ask for a new laptop or a refund of what I pay for a crapy laptop , but just an extension of my laptop $T$ for another year , they made a big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services , they finally gave in .

Another thing is that after only a month the $T$ broke and it costed $ 175 to send it in to fix it .

It 's wonderful for computer $T$ .
3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
You have to toss out the wifi card and replace it just to have any sort of $T$ .

The flaws are , this computer is not for computer gamers because of the $T$ .

They really do have the worlds very worst $T$ .
1.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
They need to stop outsoucing and send some complaint calls to US based $T$ for those who live in the United states .

4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0
Then after paying for it to be examined I was told it was same problem cited on website but I 'd have to pay anyways since it was past $T$ .
3.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0

5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0
I will definitely be getting a new laptop if it has any more issues after the $T$ expires and researching carefully when I do so I do n't run accross a situation like this again !

It has all the $T$ that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer .

It 's so bad that I 'm thinking I only got half a $T$ or something .

The Macbook is also made better , my computer has never got a virus , and the laptop $T$ just as fast as the first day I bought it .

I wiped nearly everything off of it , installed $T$ and Firefox , and I am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for a great price .

I picked it out because it was inexpensive -LRB- $ 400 -RRB- and I thought it would be a good , easy to $T$ first laptop .

Pay attention to the $T$ if you want these options .
3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 6.0 7.0 5.0 5.0 4.0
It also does not have $T$ .

Sure it has the $T$ but that was the best feature of the computer .

6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
And that probably explains why I 've already had my $T$ go bad within a year of buying it .

It 's also very capable of doing moderate $T$ -LRB- although you may need the performance boost of the larger MacBook Pros for heavy duty mobile video editing -RRB- .

My main reason to convert was the $T$ .
5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
It has a faster $T$ and more ram .
2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 2.0
It has a faster processor and more $T$ .
3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
Laptops are usually used on the go , so why not give you a better $T$ ?

I still have that stupid $T$ to !
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
Would like more trendy , high tech $T$ .
6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
$T$ is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable .

5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
I got it back again and was told the $T$ had been replaced , so I was now on the SECOND motherboard within 3 months .

The only thing I did n't learn in my research was the $T$ I would need like privacy protection and warranty protection , in case it gets broken , or crashes etc. .
4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 9.0 10.0
Comfterbale to $T$ light easy to transport .
4.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
Comfterbale to use light easy to $T$ .
2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
The Computer itself is a good product but the $T$ stinks .
5.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
I thought the $T$ was great for the specs .
2.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
I thought the price was great for the $T$ .
4.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
the only down fall is that it has no $T$ but i found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have .
4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 12.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 15.0 14.0 15.0 16.0 17.0 19.0 18.0 17.0
So , the $T$ really does n't matter to me .
5.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0
$T$ stick periodically and I havent had the laptop for 45 days yet .
0.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0
I also like that you can scroll down in a window using two fingers on the $T$ .
4.0 6.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0
Everything from the $T$ to the OS is simple and to the point .
3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 5.0

5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0
I ' v spent as much for $T$ as I would to buy a new netbook -- of course a different brand .
3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 11.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0
I personally like the $T$ but needed a machine that delivered gaming performance while still looking professional in front of my customers .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 9.0
I personally like the gaming look but needed a machine that delivered $T$ while still looking professional in front of my customers .

This just keeps having it 's $T$ replaced !
2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
When you look at the specs on Apple products in comparison to a Dell or a HP , yes they do seem to offer less for a higher $T$ .
7.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 14.0 15.0 12.0 12.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
The only downfall is the $T$ .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
Very fast $T$ and shut down .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0
Very fast boot up and $T$ .
2.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
I finally decided on this laptop because it was the right $T$ for what I need it .
3.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0
If $T$ is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a USB wireless card .
2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
If internet connectivity is important I would recommend going with a dell net book for 50 bucks more , or buy a $T$ .
8.0 8.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
I had read online that some users were having $T$ problems .
6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
My last computer , a Toshiba , $T$ only $ 400 , and worked like a charm for many years .
2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 12.0 12.0 11.0
It $T$ too quickly .
2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
But to be honest , the $T$ issues and the other little quirks make me think I ll buy a PC next time .
11.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 11.0 12.0
Then it ceased $T$ at all .
1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 3.0 2.0 1.0
I do not experience a lot of heat coming out of it , however I would highly suggest purchasing a $T$ however , due to the nature of the design of the macbook as it is one very large heat sink .

Later it held zero $T$ and its replacement worked for less than three months .

5.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 7.0
I bought it from HSN because it was `` bundled '' with extra software , but as it turns out , that $T$ just crashes it more often ...

Its Office compatible , but the $T$ and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs .

I saw walmart had the same computer for about $ 650 but still knowing what I know now , I would not buy it at that $T$ .

2.0 0.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0
The $T$ difference is next to NOTHING for a mac , and the hard drive can be manually upgraded or you could just buy a $ 60 500gb external hard drive .

2 . The $T$ is low quality .
1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 2.0
They also use two totally different $T$ .
1.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
They are about the same size $T$ .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
The people are frustrating to work with , the product itself is very cheaply made , and the $T$ are less than satisfactory .
7.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0

3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0

2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 6.0 9.0 8.0 7.0
everything about a mac is wonderful , it takes a little used to learning and getting used to the new $T$ , but you will learn fast and its all worth it .

while about 8 years ago , I hope that the $T$ has changed .
2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
The difference is it 's a whole lot of fun using the laptop now , still learning the $T$ , but is fun and comes with a lot of cool apps .

The apple systems are over priced luxurys that ar n't worth what they are being charged for , this model 's $T$ are far from being impressive and they only thing you get out of this is the apple name .

the $T$ is fine .

2.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0
This process continued to repeat itself until the $T$ had been replaced 4 times and the hard drive replaced 3 times .

3.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0
I could n't believe how long the $T$ lasted on a single charge .

8.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
I could save ten essay papers and have hardly any $T$ left .
2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
Other than that , I would recommend this to someone in need of a cheap laptop with semi-decent $T$ capabilities .
8.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
This is the first time that I tried and owning a netbook although I have used 3 different laptops in the past 10 years , I find not much difference except of course for the $T$ .

But the biggest pain is that $T$ is not available 24/7 .
3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0
The $T$ are wonderful when you are working in the dark .
9.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 9.0 8.0
I chose the iBookG4 , a laptop that is an attractive computer with a large $T$ big enough to please anyone .
3.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 3.0 4.0
The most recent being that my $T$ is freaking out on me , but I have just been using firefox instead .
4.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0

Everything about the Mac is not only visually appealing , but very easy to $T$ .
4.0 6.0 7.0 9.0 8.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
I know what 7 hrs of $T$ looks like .
2.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
I did not have to call the $T$ at all .
5.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
The laptop is outstanding in all aspects except that it has the $T$ and not the full Windows 7 .
4.0 4.0 3.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0

THE FIRST PROBLEM IS THAT THE $T$ IS SIMPLY UNSATISFACTORY .
6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0
The $T$ randomly pops open when it is in my backpack as well , which is annoying .
7.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 9.0 10.0 11.0
$T$ is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working microphone , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .
0.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 11.0 10.0 9.0
Garageband is more for the musicians , and the laptop is equipped with a good working $T$ , good enough for beginners and musicians at the intermediate level .

I dual boot with $T$ and that other security-prone OS and it performs flawlessly .
4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0

2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 8.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
The difference is the Toshiba had a lot more $T$ and hard drive space .
3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0

1.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the $T$ ca n't be used with the iBook .
5.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0
There was a little difficulty doing the migration as the firewire cable system ca n't be used with the $T$ .

Seems like maybe a bad $T$ from Toshiba .
2.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
$T$ is solid with lots of innovations such as quicklook which save heaps of time .

But other than that I am blown away by all the $T$ this laptop offers .
3.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0

16.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 14.0 17.0 16.0 15.0

First the $T$ goes completely out .
2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0
I 'm learning the finger options for the $T$ that allow for quicker browsing of web pages .
12.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0

I had to pay for the $T$ !
3.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0
It bluescreened on me without any warning , running simply basic $T$ .
2.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 0.0 1.0
I took 3-4 years researching brands and $T$ of laptops .
3.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0 3.0 3.0
We researched and found the best $T$ at MacConnection .
2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0
But guess what ? -LRB- you have to buy an $T$ it does n't have a built in type -RRB- The notebook ca n't be used because it does n't read anything for an external drive .

If you 're looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play a graphics-intensive $T$ , you 'd be better off getting a machine aimed at that segment of the market .

so in a brief summary i would have to say that i would not recommend dell vostro 1000 to anyone due to it being a down right awful $T$ so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want a decent laptop .
4.0 18.0 17.0 18.0 19.0 20.0 16.0 15.0 14.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 9.0 11.0 10.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 7.0 6.0 5.0

$T$ will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another , and I am not kidding you , I called different hours of the day and you 'll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again , since they make it sound like they do n't have your history list of your calls right in front of them .

After way too many times sending the thing in for repairs -LRB- $T$ was slow , and without the laptop I had no access to the internet , and thus no way of tracking it to find out when I might hope to see my computer again -RRB- , it finally kicked the bucket after just over 2 years .

They break down just as often as PCs do , and the only reason they do n't get viruses , is because no one makes viruses for them , they 're not better in any way , they are worse , try finding $T$ , they do n't exist .

The repairs were made quickly though I must say , however the second time they $T$ it to the incorrect address and it took nearly a week for them to get it to me .
