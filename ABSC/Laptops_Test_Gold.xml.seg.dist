3.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0
Luckily , for all of us contemplating the decision , the Mac Mini is $T$ just right .

2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0
Strong build though which really adds to its $T$ .
2.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 1.0
Strong $T$ though which really adds to its durability .

Biggest complaint is $T$ .
1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
Only 2 $T$ ... seems kind of ... limited .
2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0
It has all the expected $T$ and more + plus a wide screen and more than roomy keyboard .

Amazing $T$ for anything I throw at it .
6.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0

2.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 2.0
I was extremely happy with the $T$ itself .
3.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 2.0
The new MBP offers great $T$ and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months .
3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 7.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 4.0 4.0 3.0
The criticism has waned , and now I 'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly $T$ .
5.0 11.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
I would have given it 5 starts was it not for the fact that it had $T$
1.0 13.0 12.0 11.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 7.0 8.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0
$T$ is wonderful , well worth it .
0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 2.0 3.0
But the $T$ of Mac Mini is a huge disappointment .

It 's light and easy to $T$ .

3.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 1.0
I had the same reasons as most PC users : the $T$ , the overbearing restrictions of OSX and lack of support for games .

4.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 0.0 0.0
Having $T$ is why I bought this Mini .

3.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 6.0 5.0 5.0 4.0

$T$ is a mixed bag .

It suddenly can not $T$ .
2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
$T$ was in poor condition , had to replace it .
0.0 5.0 4.0 5.0 7.0 6.0 3.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0
The $T$ is a bit obscure in the rear corner .
5.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 4.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 5.0 4.0 5.0

The only solution is to turn the $T$ down , etc. .

My one complaint is that there was no $T$ .
2.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
This newer netbook has no $T$ or network lights .

Not too expense and has enough $T$ for most users and many ports .
3.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 5.0 4.0

4.0 9.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0
The $T$ is quite low and virtually unusable in a room with any background activity .
1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 2.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0

The MBP is beautiful has many wonderful $T$ .
2.0 6.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 1.0
I thought that it will be fine , if i do some $T$ .
5.0 10.0 10.0 9.0 8.0 7.0 6.0 5.0 6.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 0.0 1.0
$T$ very smoothly .

$T$ slowed significantly after all Windows updates were installed .

Boot-up slowed significantly after all $T$ were installed .
4.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 3.0 2.0

But I wanted the Pro for the $T$ .
2.0 5.0 4.0 3.0 2.0 3.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 1.0
I was a little worry at first because I do n't have a lot of experience with $T$ and windows has always been second nature to me after many years of using windows .

At home and the office it gets plugged into an external 24 '' LCD screen , so $T$ is not terribly important .
